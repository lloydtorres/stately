### Contributions

Stately is an open-source project â€” contributions are always welcome! Please keep in mind the following project tenets before working with Stately code:

1. **Improve the NationStates experience, don't detract from it.** NationStates players should be able to jump right into Stately and figure out how things work intuitively. Features shouldn't stray too far from convention and confuse players.
2. **The Material Design aesthetic comes first.** Stately prides itself on its clean, sleek and modern interface based on Material Design. Features should match or improve upon the app's existing aesthetic.
3. **Security and privacy are paramount.** Stately should only interact with NationStates when handling user data. Other than receiving crash reports, Stately's developers should not be aware of any actions in the app.
4. **Compatibility should be maintained whenever possible.** Stately runs on a variety of Android devices. Future updates should work on both modern flagship phones and on older devices we've previously supported.
5. **Off-the-shelf solutions work better in the long run.** To keep Stately robust, changes should be built on stock Android libraries and existing dependencies. Data consumed from the NationStates API should be from documented shards.

All proposed changes to the app should be submitted as [pull requests](https://github.com/lloydtorres/stately/pulls) to the main GitHub repository. Additionally, major changes (e.g. new features or UI changes) should have a [tracking issue](https://github.com/lloydtorres/stately/issues) for it. The project owner will work with the contributor on getting their code released in an app update through these channels.

#### Translations

Stately is entirely dependent on NationStates and its API, which provides in-game content (such as issues and nation descriptions) solely in English; a significant portion of Stately will therefore still be in English even if every in-app string is translated into another language. As a result, in-app string translations will **not** be accepted at this time.
